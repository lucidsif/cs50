1.  stdint.h is a header file to standarize integer types across different environments and make integers of custom sizes.
2. These are integer types with a specific size and range. Usin a normal int gives no garauntee about how many bits an int is and is dependant on the compiler.
3.  1, 4, 4, and 2.
4.  BM
5.  bfSize is the total number of bytes in the file while biSize is number of bytes in info header
6.  If biHeight is positive, the bitmap is a bottom-up DIB and its origin is the lower-left corner. If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper-left corner.
7.  biBitCount
8.  If it cannot open the file for any reason
9.  That argument specifies how many elements to read and it's always reading only one struct.
10. 3
11. moves to a specific location in a file
12. an integer constant that when used as argument to fseek or fseeko, specifies thath the offset provided is relative to the current file position
